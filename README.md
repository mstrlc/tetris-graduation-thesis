### Graduation thesis – Tetris in C# and Windows Forms

This was my "graduation thesis" for the Programming seminar at [Jiráskovo gymnázium Náchod](https://www.gymnachod.cz/) (grammar school) for the last 2 years of school.

I programmed the game Tetris in C# using Windows Forms as a GUI. I created the graphical interface and programmed the game logic.
It counts score, the levels keep increasing and thus the game is more difficult with larger score, there are randomly generated
tetris pieces.

This was my first bigger programming projects, so it's very messy. There are not many comments and if there are, they're in Czech.
THe error handling was a last-minute fix so it's handled very ineffectively with try-catch blocks, which makes the game slow.
But I'd say it's playable, so if you want to, you can download it and compile it yourself. I created it in Visual Studio 2018, so that should work well.

In the future, I want to clean it up and comment bits of code. Also I want to create a downloadable executable file so anyone can play.
